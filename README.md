# React/Redux - Simple Demo

This is simple react-redux demo. Using node js to get mock json data.

Please note that this repository packages are using older versions of react, react-redux and redux.
And this is legacy way of create/configure `redux store` using `thunk` middleware and dispatch actions to components using `bindActionCreators`
